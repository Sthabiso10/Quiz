A new Flutter project.

## Working with data models

Welcome to the Quiz App project! This is a simple quiz application built using Flutter and Dart, with static data. Users can test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions on various topics.

This project is was a way for me to come to grips wih woring with dummy data/data models.

## Features

- Multiple Choice Questions: Users can select answers from a list of options.
- Score Tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
- Static Data: Questions and answers are pre-defined within the application code.
- User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for a smooth user experience.

## Usage

To use the Quiz App, ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and run the app using Flutter commands. The quiz will start automatically, presenting questions one by one. Select your answers and click 'Next' to proceed to the next question. At the end of the quiz, your total score will be displayed.
